The following code shows how to create shape variants by manipulating a shape's skeletal representation.  The skeletal representation decomposes the shape into parts.  Here we vary the relationship of the lengths, orientations, widths, and positions of all these parts to create new shape variants.  Such new variants may be useful in producing stimuli for a variety of psychophysical tasks.
