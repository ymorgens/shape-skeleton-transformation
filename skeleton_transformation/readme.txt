Here we show how you can create entire classes of objects by manipulating a shape's skeletal representation.  The skeletal representation decomposes the shape into parts.  Here we show how to vary the relationship of the lengths, orientations, widths, and positions of all these parts to create new shape variants.  Such new variants may be useful in producing stimuli for a variety of psychophysical tasks.
